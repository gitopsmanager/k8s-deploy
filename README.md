# üöÄ Reusable GitHub Workflow: Kubernetes App Deployment with ArgoCD ‚Äî *Open Source* & Stable `@v2`

This reusable workflow automates Kubernetes application deployment using [Kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/) and [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).  


It renders manifest files using **Jinja2-style templating implemented with [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)**, commits the results into your **continuous deployment (CD) repo**, and uses the **ArgoCD REST API** to create, sync, and validate applications.
It also uploads artifacts for the **Kustomize build** and the **templated files** to be checked into the CD repo, which can be used for **troubleshooting any issues with Kustomize**.

üß© **Open Source:** Maintained by **Affinity7 Consulting Ltd**, this workflow is part of the [**GitOps Manager‚Ñ¢**](https://gitopsmanager.io) open-source toolchain ‚Äî powering both community and enterprise GitOps automation across AWS and Azure.

> ‚úÖ **First-time deployments are supported** ‚Äì ArgoCD apps are auto-created if missing.  
> üóëÔ∏è **Optional `delete_first`** ‚Äì force ArgoCD app deletion before re-create (**then performs a full redeploy**).  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Self-hosted runner required** ‚Äì must have cluster network access and tooling installed.

## üìä Collection of Usage Metrics

This workflow reports **non-identifiable usage metrics** to help the maintainers understand adoption and improve open-source GitOps tooling.

Each run sends a small JSON payload like:
```json
{
  "action": "deploy",
  "org": "<hashed>",
  "repo": "<hashed>",
  "timestamp": "2025-11-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Data is sent to [gitopsmanager.io/github-action-metrics](https://gitopsmanager.io/github-action-metrics) and used only for **aggregate, anonymized statistics** shown publicly on [gitopsmanager.io](https://gitopsmanager.io).

> No source code, credentials, or personal information are ever transmitted.  
> Telemetry is opt-in via usage; there‚Äôs no persistent tracking or external identifiers.

---

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Privacy & Metrics Summary

**GitOps Manager‚Ñ¢** collects limited, anonymous usage metrics to understand adoption and display community activity on [gitopsmanager.io](https://gitopsmanager.io).

**What we publicly display**
- Aggregate counts of **organizations**, **repositories**, **builds**, and **deploys**  
- These totals are shown on the website as global usage summaries

**How data is handled**
- Each organization and repository is represented by an **anonymized hash key**  
- Hashes cannot be reversed or linked to any identifiable information  
- Raw telemetry records (hashed only) are stored privately and used solely to compute aggregate totals  
- Only the aggregated counts are displayed publicly ‚Äî no raw data is exposed

**What we never collect**
- No personal data, source code, credentials, or identifiable metadata are ever captured or transmitted

Telemetry is an integral part of the system‚Äôs design.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Inputs

### Core
| Name                 | Required | Type     | Default | Description |
|----------------------|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `github_runner`      | ‚úÖ       | string   | ‚Äì       | Label of the self-hosted runner (must have cluster access) |
| `namespace`          | ‚úÖ       | string   | ‚Äì       | Kubernetes namespace for deployment |
| `target_environment` | ‚úÖ       | string   | `dev`   | Logical environment (`dev`, `qa`, `prod`). Still required even if `target_cluster` is set, as it controls approvals and environment scoping. |
| `target_cluster`     | ‚ùå       | string   | `""`    | If set, resolves the cluster **globally across all `env_map` environments** by matching the `cluster` name. If omitted, the cluster is resolved from the given `target_environment` only. |
| `ref`                | ‚ùå       | string   | `${{ github.ref || github.sha }}` | Git reference (branch, tag, or commit SHA) for source repo checkout |
| `delete_first`       | ‚ùå       | boolean  | `false` | Delete ArgoCD app(s) before deploying (**then redeploy**). |
| `delete_only`        | ‚ùå       | boolean  | `false` | If `true`, the workflow will **only delete ArgoCD apps** for the specified cluster/namespace and clean up their corresponding directories in the CD repo. |
| `cd_repo`            | ‚úÖ       | string   | ‚Äì       | Continuous deployment repo where templated manifests are committed |
| `cd_repo_org`        | ‚úÖ       | string   | ‚Äì       | Continuous deployment repo organization |
| `github_environment` | ‚ùå       | string   | ‚Äì       | GitHub Environment for approvals and env-scoped secrets |

---
> ### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Additional note
> The workflow **checks for presence of `ARGOCD_CA_CERT`** and reports its length for debugging purposes.

---

### Deployment Modes
- **Mode A: Single App**
  - `application` (string)  
  - `deploy_path` (string, default `Deployments`)  
  - `image_tag` (string, optional)  
  - `image_base_name` (string, optional)  
  - `image_base_names` (comma-separated string, optional)  
  - `overlay_dir` (string, required)

- **Mode B: Multi App**
  - `application_details` (JSON array, optional)  
    ```json
    [
      {"name":"app1","images":["repo/app1","repo/sidecar"],"path":"services/app1/overlays/prod"},
      {"name":"app2","images":["repo/app2"],"path":"apps/app2/overlays/prod"}
    ]
    ```

---

### Environment Map

The workflow needs an `env_map` that defines your environments, clusters, and related metadata.  
You can provide it in **two ways**:

1. As a workflow input (`with: env_map: "<JSON>"`) ‚úÖ **preferred**  
2. As an environment variable (`ENV_MAP` from the runner) ‚Äî fallback for self-hosted runners  

If neither is provided, the workflow fails.

---

#### Cluster Resolution Logic

1. If `target_cluster` is set:  
   - Searches **all clusters across all environments** in the `env_map`.  
   - Selects by exact cluster name (case-insensitive).  

2. If `target_cluster` is not set:  
   - Looks inside the `target_environment` only.  
   - If single cluster ‚Üí use it.  
   - If multiple clusters ‚Üí fail with error listing options.  

---

#### Example env_map JSON

```json
{
  "dev": {
    "cluster_count": 1,
    "clusters": [
      { "cluster": "aks-dev-weu", "dns_zone": "internal.dev.example.com", "container_registry": "ghcr.io/my-org", "uami_map": [] }
    ]
  },
  "prod": {
    "cluster_count": 2,
    "clusters": [
      { "cluster": "aks-prod-weu", "dns_zone": "internal.example.com", "container_registry": "ghcr.io/my-org", "uami_map": [] },
      { "cluster": "aks-prod-use", "dns_zone": "internal.example.com", "container_registry": "ghcr.io/my-org", "uami_map": [] }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## üîë UAMI Mapping for Azure Workload Identity

When deploying to **Azure AKS**, some clusters may define **User Assigned Managed Identities (UAMIs)** in the `env_map`.  
These are passed as an array under `uami_map`:

```json
"uami_map": [
  {
    "uami_name": "prodcluster-app-uami",
    "uami_resource_group": "rg-demo",
    "client_id": "1111-aaaa"
  },
  {
    "uami_name": "sidecar-uami",
    "uami_resource_group": "rg-demo",
    "client_id": "2222-bbbb"
  }
]
```

---

### How UAMI vars are exported

For each entry:

1. **Take the `uami_name`**  
   - If it starts with `<cluster_name>-` (the selected cluster name followed by a dash), that prefix is **removed**.  
     - Example: `prodcluster-app-uami` ‚Üí `app-uami`.

2. **Normalize the name**  
   - Replace `-` with `_`.  
     - Example: `sidecar-uami` ‚Üí `sidecar_uami`.  
   - If the result doesn‚Äôt start with a letter or `_`, prepend `_`.  
     - Example: `123-identity` ‚Üí `_123_identity`.

3. **Export as environment variable**  
   - Variable name = normalized `uami_name` (lowercased).  
   - Value = `client_id` of the UAMI.  
   - Written into `$GITHUB_ENV`, so it‚Äôs available to all subsequent steps.

4. **Deduplicate**  
   - If two UAMIs normalize to the same name, duplicates are skipped with a warning.

---

### Example Result

Input:

```json
"uami_map": [
  {"uami_name": "prodcluster-app-uami", "uami_resource_group": "rg-demo", "client_id": "1111-aaaa"},
  {"uami_name": "sidecar-uami", "uami_resource_group": "rg-demo", "client_id": "2222-bbbb"}
]
```

Output exported vars:

```bash
app_uami=1111-aaaa
sidecar_uami=2222-bbbb
```

---

### Usage in Manifests

You can reference these exported variables during **Jinja2 templating with Nunjucks**:

```yaml
env:
  - name: APP_UAMI_CLIENT_ID
    value: {{ app_uami }}
  - name: SIDECAR_UAMI_CLIENT_ID
    value: {{ sidecar_uami }}
```

---

### Delete-Only Mode

| Name          | Required | Type     | Default | Description |
|---------------|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `delete_only` | ‚ùå       | boolean  | `false` | If `true`, the workflow will **only delete ArgoCD apps** for the specified cluster/namespace and clean up their corresponding directories in the CD repo. |

---

#### How it works

When `delete_only: true`:

- **Runs**:
  - Environment resolution (`env_map` / `target_environment` / `target_cluster`)  
  - Authentication (`argocd_auth_token` or username/password)  
  - ArgoCD connection setup (`argocd_conn`)  
  - ArgoCD app deletion (API calls)  
  - Cleanup of app directories in the **CD repo** (`continuous-deployment/<cluster>/<namespace>/<app>`)  
  - Commit & push of deletions to the CD repo  

- **Skips**:
  - Manifest templating with Nunjucks  
  - Image patching  
  - `kustomize build`  
  - Uploading artifacts  
  - Creating or syncing ArgoCD apps  

This mode is useful for **cleanly tearing down apps** in both ArgoCD **and** your CD repo, leaving no trace of the app‚Äôs manifests.

> üìå **Telemetry note:** delete-only runs still record a `deploy` event for aggregate usage totals.

---

#### Example Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  delete:
    uses: gitopsmanager/k8s-deploy/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml@v2
    with:
      github_runner: my-self-hosted
      cd_repo: continuous-deployment
      cd_repo_org: my-org
      github_environment: prod
      target_environment: prod
      target_cluster: aks-prod-weu
      namespace: my-namespace
      delete_only: true
    secrets:
      CONTINUOUS_DEPLOYMENT_GH_APP_ID: ${{ secrets.CD_GH_APP_ID }}
      CONTINUOUS_DEPLOYMENT_GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{ secrets.CD_GH_APP_KEY }}
      ARGOCD_CA_CERT: ${{ secrets.ARGOCD_CA_CERT }}
```

## üèó ArgoCD URL Assumption

ArgoCD ingress must be reachable at:

```
https://${cluster}-argocd-argocd-web-ui.${dns_zone}
```

> You can override this by patching the `argocd_conn` step in the workflow if your ingress differs.

---

## üî¢ Versioning Policy ‚Äî Official Release

Starting with this release, all `v2` versions follow the same **stable tagging model** used across GitOps Manager‚Ñ¢ Actions.

| Tag | Moves When | Purpose |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **`v2`** | Any new release in the `v2.x.x` series | Always points to the latest stable release (no breaking changes). |
| **`v2.3`** | New patch within that feature line (e.g. `v2.3.5 ‚Üí v2.3.6`) | Tracks bug fixes and improvements only ‚Äî no new required inputs. |
| **`v2.3.7`** | Never | Fully immutable, reproducible snapshot. |

All tags will now **increment forward permanently** ‚Äî no re-use or re-tagging of old versions.
